# The Eastern Marches
*What Every Traveler Should Know*

## The Three Realms

### Coeranys: Kingdom of the Free
Coeranys is known throughout Cerilia as a land where freedom is cherished above all else. The people here are passionate, hardy folk who tend vast herds of horses and cattle across rolling grasslands.

**Common Knowledge:**
- Baroness Eluvie Cariele rules with a light hand, demanding little from her subjects
- Landrunners (those who tend the roaming herds) are highly respected in society
- The weather is notoriously stormy, with rain and mist being constant companions
- The capital of Ruorven sits along a river that serves as a vital trade route

**What People Say:**
"*In Coeranys, even the poorest farmer walks with his head held high. The Baroness may not have the strongest army, but she has the most loyal subjects.*"

### Osoerde: The Duke's Domain
Once considered a sleepy backwater, Osoerde has gained a dark reputation in recent years under Duke Jaison Raenech, who seized power from the previous ruling family.

**Common Knowledge:**
- Duke Raenech rules with an iron fist and enforces harsh laws
- Those who displease the Duke often face severe punishment
- New fortifications are being built along the northern border
- Travel to and from Osoerde has become increasingly restricted

**What People Say:**
"*Keep your head down and your opinions to yourself if you travel south of the border. The Duke's men are always watching, and the trees along the road bear grim fruit these days.*"

### The Sielwode: The Forbidden Forest
The ancient forest realm of the Sielwode stands as a mysterious presence along the eastern edge of human lands. Few have ventured deep into its shadows and returned to tell the tale.

**Common Knowledge:**
- The forest is home to elves who prefer to be left alone
- Trespassers are rarely welcomed and often never return
- The border between human lands and the Sielwode is clearly marked with ancient stones

**What People Say:**
"*The elves were here long before us, and they'll be here long after. Cross their borders at your peril. They say the trees themselves move to confuse intruders, and strange lights lead travelers astray.*"

## Life in the Eastern Marches

The rhythm of life follows the seasons, with most folk focused on farming, herding, and crafting. Border towns have grown more vigilant in recent years.
