# Dwarves

Dwarves lived in the mountains of Cerilia untold years before humans came to the land. Over time, the dwarven holds elected a defensive strategy, fortifying their approaches and retreating to their cities under the mountains when threatened. Dwarves have a fierce hatred of orogs as a result of uncounted wars fought in the deeps under the earth.

The typical dwarf stands 4 to 4½ feet in height and has an exceptionally stocky build and thick, sturdy bones. Dwarves are creatures who derive from stone—they are true children of the mountains—and their bodies are twice as dense as other creatures. As a result, dwarves weigh as much as 250 to 300 pounds.

A dwarf's skin is gray, stony, and cold to the touch. All dwarves have eyes that are dark as jet, and their hair and beards are black or dark gray and are normally cropped short.

With regard to other races, Cerilian dwarves usually adhere to a friendly neutrality; thus, they are on good terms with most other races, including the elves. They're masterful craftsmen and traders; dwarven caravans roam from Anuire to Vos laden with their goods. Dwarven arms and armor are the best in Cerilia, and it is not uncommon to see dwarves selling their services as mercenaries.

Like the standard dwarves described in the Player's Handbook, Cerilian dwarves are nonmagical and never use wizard magic. They gain the standard saving throw modifiers allowed to dwarves against magic and poison, and suffer the standard 20% chance for magic malfunction. Since they're accustomed to underground surroundings, they have the normal mining detection abilities, and Cerilian dwarves have infravision with a range of 90 feet.

Dwarves gain no bonuses to attack rolls against specific monsters and have no special skill at fighting giants, but orogs and ogres subtract 2 from attack rolls against a Cerilian dwarf. A dwarf's dense body suffers half damage from bludgeoning or crushing attacks. Dwarves can carry amazing burdens, and for purposes of encumbrance, a dwarf's strength is considered four points higher than his actual score. (Each percentage bracket from 18/01 to 18/00 counts as one point.)
