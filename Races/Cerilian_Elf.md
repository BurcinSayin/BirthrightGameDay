# Elves

The elves of Cerilia are a graceful but reclusive race, suspicious of humankind. Early in Cerilia's history, the elves contested human settlement of the continent's vast forests, and a strong current of ill will toward the human nations still runs strong in the elven woods.

There is only one race of Cerilian elves; they call themselves the Sidhelien (SHEE-lin). The Sidhelien hold court in deep, mist-wreathed vales in the darkest hearts of the ancient Cerilian forests.

Elves stand as tall as humans, but are far more slender and graceful. Most average 5Â½ to 6 feet in height, but weigh only 120 to 140 pounds. All have fair skin and dark hair, and their features are exquisitely fine. Elves possess an unearthly beauty, and their perfect voices can hold a mortal spellbound.

Unfortunately, elves are too mindful of their superiority and treat outsiders with coldness or condescension. Cerilian elves are creatures of faerie dust and starlight, gifted with immortality and powers of mind and body beyond those of humankind. They are a force for neither good nor evil; an elven wood can be perilous for human travelers, but even more so for goblins or gnolls.

The elven heart is unfathomable to nonelves; they're moved to wild delight, dark melancholy, or burning rage with only the slightest cause. More than anything else, elves are unpredictable, doing what pleases them from one moment to the next.

As described in the PHB, elves resist sleep and charm spells (90% resistance). They are unaffected by aging attacks and normal disease (only magical diseases such as lycanthropy or mummy rot can harm them). Cerilian elves have no infravision or ability to see in total darkness, but can see by starlight or moonlight as well as a human sees by daylight. Elves don't need sleep, but they can become physically exhausted and must rest quietly, studying spells or standing watch, for about as long as a human needs to sleep.

Cerilian elves have no special attack bonuses and no ability to detect secret doors or concealed objects, but they are able to surprise opponents when alone as described in the PHB. Elves in Cerilia pass without trace in natural settings and ignore ground characteristics when moving or marching; an elf can travel over heavy snow, soft sand, or a treacherous mountainside as easily as a human walks across a smooth wooden floor.

Cerilian elves follow any nonlawful alignment; it's not in their natures to place the values of society above the freedom of the individual.
