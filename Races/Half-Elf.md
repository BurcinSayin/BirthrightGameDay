# Half-elves

From time to time, a particularly handsome or beautiful human with courage and a gracious manner may walk among the Sidhelien unscathed. A few humans have even been accepted as equals in the elven courts. Mortals (by elven standards) quickly become lost in the elven spell; the years reel by in splendor and celebration, while the world outside comes to a halt or leaps centuries ahead. Such a mortal may return home to find that only a single night has passed, or that a hundred years have flown by. More often than not, a mortal's life runs out in a heartbeat.

Half-elves are the rare children of these unusual men and women and their elf partners. The elves regard such offspring as Sidhelien and welcome them fully in elf society. Humans, however, tend to be suspicious of half-elves, referring to them as bewitched or as changelings; it is rare for half-elves to leave the elven woods.

Like their elven parents, half-elves are beautiful and graceful, but their builds are heavierâ€”they fall within the human ranges for height and weight. Half-elves have 30% resistance to sleep and charm spells and effects, and 30% resistance to disease and aging attacks. They share their elven parent's night vision, but must sleep as much as a normal human.
