# Humans

Humans are the most populous race in Cerilia and inhabit every part of the continent. Five human nationalities or cultures currently exist: the Anuireans, the Khinasi, the Brechts, the Rjurik, and the Vos.

## Anuireans
Anuireans are native to the southwestern portion of Cerilia. The ancient Anuireans were a fair-skinned, red-haired people, but over centuries of extensive contact with other cultures, Anuireans have lost most defining physical characteristics.

Anuirean society is semifeudal and based on a class of free farmers and craftsmen. Regents (rulers of domains) are usually titled nobles. Anuireans respect nobility and look to their leaders to protect them from the barbarians and savages who surround the state of the old Empire. Commoners identify strongly with their lords, and the dealings and alliances of the noble families are topics of continuous discussion throughout Anuirean lands.

## Brechts
The Brechts inhabit north-central Cerilia. They tend to be short and stocky, with dark hair and eyes. Early in their history, they were under the rule of Anuirean governors, and Brecht nobility declined drastically in power and importance. When the Anuirean Empire fell and the Brechts gained independence, the guilds and merchants came into power. The nobility is weak in Brechtür, and several states have declared themselves republics.

The Brechts believe in free enterprise, and Brecht society revolves around wealth. The Brechts have a fierce love of independence and a tradition of self-reliance; they don't wait for their lords or rulers to solve problems for them. Commerce and trade are expressions of this belief, and Brecht commoners owe their first loyalty to guilds and companies.

## Khinasi
Khinasi characters are native to the region known as Khinasi. They're descended from the Basarji, and speak the language of the same name. The Basarji arrived in Cerilia from lands across the Sea of Dragons. They are tall and lanky, with aquiline features and dark eyes. Their complexions range from a light coffee to a dark brown color.

Unlike the other human cultures, the Khinasi have no fear of magic. The study of magic is considered the noblest of callings, and the Khinasi universities devoted to magic are the finest in Cerilia. Like the Brechts, Khinasi commoners are traders and merchants, but an individual's decorum, hospitality, and conduct are far more important than gross wealth.

## Rjurik
The Rjurik inhabit the taiga forests and highlands of northwestern Cerilia. They are a tall, broad-shouldered people with blond or red hair and fair complexions. Men and women most commonly wear their hair in long braids.

The Rjurik are stubborn individualists who don't swear fealty to anyone but their own kin; the family is the most important part of Rjurik life. Most Rjurik follow the god Erik, a druidical power, and druids are revered throughout Rjurik society as teachers, leaders, and advisers. All Rjurik have a deep respect and love for Cerilia's wilds, and carefully avoid over-hunting or clearing virgin forest.

## Vos
The Vos are a barbaric race from the cold mountains and forests of northeastern Cerilia. They are tall, thick-boned people with flat features, light eyes, and sallow skin. Male warriors are fond of shaving their heads and wearing long, drooping mustaches.

The Vos have a rigid code of face and honor that demands blood for even unintentional insults. Their leaders are war-chieftains known as tsarevos who are advised by the priests of the grim Vos gods. Almost all Vos men are warriors and hunters—other professions are considered unmanly. Vos women are by custom greatly limited in their freedoms, although a few women have succeeded as warriors or tsarevos.
