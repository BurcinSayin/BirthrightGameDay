# The Gods of Cerilia

## Common Knowledge of the Divine

Throughout Cerilia, the gods shape daily life through their temples, priests, and influence. While devout followers know the deeper teachings of their patron deity, here is what any common person would know about the major powers that watch over the land.

## The Great Gods

### Haelyn
**Lord of Noble War, Lawmaker, Patron of Anuire**  
*Symbol: Sword and sunburst*

Haelyn is widely recognized as the ruler of the gods and the patron of Anuire. He stands for justice, courage, chivalry, and honorable warfare. His temples are centers of political power in Anuirean lands, where his priests often serve as royal advisors. Many knights and warriors swear oaths in his name, and his symbol can be found on countless shields and banners across the realm.

### Avani
**Goddess of the Sun, Lady of Reason**  
*Symbol: Setting sun*

Avani is revered as the sun goddess and patroness of wisdom and logic. Her temples resemble universities or libraries, filled with scholars and sages. In Khinasi lands, she holds particular prominence, where it is said the sun is her golden palace circling the world each day. Many seek her guidance in matters requiring clear judgment or rational thinking.

### Erik
**Old Father of the Forests, Patron of Rjurik**  
*Symbol: Oak tree*

Erik watches over the wilderness and serves as guardian of Cerilia's forests and animals. His druids are common sights in the northern forests of Rjurik lands, where they maintain sacred groves and ensure that humans take no more from the land than it can bear to lose. Hunters and woodsmen leave small offerings to Erik before harvesting from his domain.

## The Intermediate Gods

### Sera
**Lady of Fortune, Goddess of Wealth**  
*Symbol: Scales*

Sera is invoked by merchants, gamblers, and anyone seeking good fortune. Her favor is said to smile upon the hardworking, though occasionally upon the foolhardy as well. Particularly revered in Brechtür, where commerce drives society, her priests often serve as officials of trade. Many traders carry small tokens bearing her scales symbol for good luck on dangerous routes.

### Nesirie
**Goddess of the Sea, Lady of Mourning**  
*Symbol: Wave and trident*

Nesirie watches over sailors and those who make their living from the sea. Coastal communities maintain small shrines where offerings are made before voyages. She is also the goddess of grief, and those who have suffered great losses often find comfort at her temples. Fishermen claim that dolphins and certain seabirds are her messengers.

### Belinik
**Prince of Terror, Lord of Strife**  
*Symbol: Crossed axes*

Feared more than worshipped in most civilized lands, Belinik is the patron of meaningless violence and cruel warfare. His temples operate openly only in Vosgaard, where his priests wield considerable influence. Most common folk make warding signs when his name is mentioned, though some warriors secretly offer prayers before battle, seeking his bloody favor.

## The Lesser Gods

### Laerme
**Goddess of Fire, Beauty, and Art**  
*Symbol: Harp and flame*

Laerme's influence touches all who create beauty or experience love. Artists, musicians, and young lovers often make small offerings at her shrines. While few temples are solely dedicated to her worship, many people call upon her for matters of the heart regardless of their primary deity. Her priests are often welcome advisors in noble courts for their artistic talents.

### Ruornil
**The Moon God, the Silver Prince**  
*Symbol: Crescent moon*

Ruornil is the patron of magic and arcane knowledge. All who practice wizardry acknowledge his influence, even if they do not formally worship him. His temples are often hidden in remote woodlands, though in Anuire some have gained political influence. Commoners sometimes leave small offerings on windowsills during the full moon to ensure peaceful dreams.

### Cuiraécen
**Stormlord, God of Battle**  
*Symbol: Sword and lightning*

Son of Haelyn and Nesirie, Cuiraécen represents the glory and chaos of battle rather than its nobility. Young warriors seeking fame and fortune often call upon him before combat. His temples maintain powerful orders of knight templars in Anuire, though they remain relatively small elsewhere. During thunderstorms, some say the lightning is his spear striking the earth.

### Eloéle
**Goddess of Night, Sister of Thieves**  
*Symbol: Black dagger*

Few honest folk openly worship Eloéle, though most are careful not to speak ill of her. Thieves and rogues seek her blessing before setting to work, and traveling merchants might leave a small coin at a crossroads to ensure she doesn't take interest in their purses. Small shrines can be found in the shadows of larger cities, visited discreetly by those with secrets to keep.

### Kriesha
**The Ice Lady, the Winter Witch**  
*Symbol: White hand*

Kriesha is feared in most lands, especially during harsh winters when her power is strongest. The Rjurik and Brechts know to leave offerings during the first snow to placate her anger. In Vosgaard, her priestesses command great respect and use their powers to test the strength of warriors. Most common folk tell tales of those who wandered into blizzards, lured by her cold beauty.

## Common Religious Practices

Across Cerilia, people typically honor multiple gods as circumstances require, while maintaining primary devotion to their cultural patron. A Rjurik hunter might primarily worship Erik but still offer a prayer to Sera before trading furs, or to Kriesha when winter approaches. Temples of various gods exist in most settlements of significant size, with greater prominence given to culturally significant deities.

Common folk participate in seasonal festivals honoring appropriate gods, make offerings during important life events, and may wear small symbols of divine protection. While the nobility might sponsor grand temples and maintain personal chaplains, ordinary people practice their faith through simple daily rituals and community gatherings at local shrines.
